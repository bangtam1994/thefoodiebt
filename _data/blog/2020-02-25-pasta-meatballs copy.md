Sugo all’Amatriciana is basically the national sauce of Italy (and Rome in particular), so I’m sure an Italian person would say I bastardized this version, because it’s true, I did. But it was phenomenally bastardized.

Classically, Amatriciana sauce is guanciale, rendered fat from the guanciale, tomato sauce, and pecorino cheese. The fatty part of the (very high quality) leftover Christmas ham did a great job replacing guanciale. I also changed out the tomato sauce and used parmigiano reggiano instead of pecorino. So basically, I followed the formula but changed every ingredient.
