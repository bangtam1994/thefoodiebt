**For me, bulgogi is the most iconic Korean dish that’s not kimchi.**

It’s super thin and tender sliced beef, pork, or chicken, marinated in a subtle sweet and spicy sauce, charred to perfection. It’s one of the greatest things ever and a perfect introduction to Korean food. If you’ve never had it, it’s something new and wonderful that will immensely add to your quality of life, and if you’ve already had it, then I don’t need to go any further: you know what I’m talking about.



**In my opinion, Bulgogi should always be spicy.** What is it about Korean food that is so much better spicy?
