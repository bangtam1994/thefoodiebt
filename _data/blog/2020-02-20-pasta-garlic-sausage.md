This sausage garlic parmesan pasta is probably the best thing you can make with only 5 ingredients and 15 minutes. It’s easily as good as any \$25 plate of pasta you’d get at a nice Italian restaurant, assuming any survive this COVID-19 crisis. Besides being super easy, you can endlessly riff on this basic recipe with different kinds of sausages, cured meats, or fresh pasta.
